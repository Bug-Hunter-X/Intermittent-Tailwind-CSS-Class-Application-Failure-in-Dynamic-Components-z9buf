The solution often involves ensuring that the dynamic components are fully hydrated or that the correct CSS is injected into the client-side.  Techniques include:

1. **Using `@apply` Carefully**: Avoid overusing `@apply`.  Complex uses of `@apply` can sometimes cause problems during hydration.
2. **Ensure Proper CSS Injection**: Verify that all necessary Tailwind CSS styles are correctly included in your application's build process.
3. **Explicit Hydration or Rendering**: If using server-side rendering, ensure the dynamic component is correctly hydrated.  Use methods provided by your framework to wait for hydration before applying the classes.
4. **Component Structure Review**: Review the complexity and nesting structure of your components.  Consider refactoring deeply nested structures for better clarity and performance.
5. **Conditional Class Application**: Only apply classes after component initialization or hydration has completed. This might involve using state or `useEffect` hook to ensure that the classes are applied at the correct time. (Next.js/React Example)

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [isHydrated, setIsHydrated] = React.useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsHydrated(true);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className={isHydrated ? "bg-blue-500 p-4" : ""}> 
      Hydration check: {isHydrated ? 'Hydrated' : 'Not Hydrated'}
    </div>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```
