# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply consistently to dynamically rendered or deeply nested components within a Next.js or Nuxt.js application. The problem is often intermittent and difficult to debug, manifesting only under certain conditions.

## Problem Description

The core issue is that Tailwind classes, while correctly defined and included in the component's styling, sometimes do not render on the client-side. This is particularly noticeable with components that are dynamically rendered (e.g., using client-side routing or data fetching) or those nested deeply within other components.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the intermittent application of Tailwind classes on dynamically rendered elements or those in deeply nested structures.  The issue is likely to appear more frequently in deeper nesting scenarios.

## Potential Solutions

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a potential solution using techniques like ensuring that all required CSS is properly injected, reviewing the usage of `@apply` directives for potential conflicts and using techniques to ensure the component is hydrated or fully rendered before the classes are applied.  If this does not resolve the issue, further debugging is likely necessary by inspecting the browser's developer tools.
